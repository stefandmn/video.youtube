# YouTube Plugin for Clue MCPi

**YouTube** plugin is designed to play videos and also do display/list main items 
published on YouTube website. It is a complete version of __YouTube__ video plugin 
for **Clue MCPi** and also Kodi distributions. 
The plugin is a totally independent add-on providing two working models: by delivering 
content through classical Youtube content parsing (website) and also relaying on 
**Youtube_DL** library (using Youtube API).
